/**
 * FDF (Forms Data Format) is a kind of file format, used for interactive form data. FDF can be used
 * when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating it into the interactive form.
 * It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be stored, transmitted electronically,
 * and imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. Besides these, FDF can be used to
 * define a container for annotations that are separated from the PDF document to which they apply.<br>
 * XFDF(XML Forms Data Format) is a version of FDF based on XML. It has similar features with FDF.<br>
 * In a word, FDF and XFDF contain the subset of a PDF document to describe interactive forms and annotations.<br>
 * Class @link FDFDoc @endlink can be used to represent either FDF or XFDF. A FDF document object can be constructed with
 * an existing file from file path, memory buffer, a custom implemented @link common::file::ReaderCallback @endlink object and
 * an input file stream. A FDF document object can also be constructed as a new FDF or XFDF document.
 * This class also offers functions to get or set some information from FDF or XFDF file,
 * and save current FDF/XFDF as another file.<br>
 * To import or export form fields or annotations, please refer to functions @link pdf::PDFDoc::ImportFromFDF @endlink,
 * @link pdf::PDFDoc::ExportToFDF @endlink and @link pdf::PDFDoc::ExportAnnotToFDF @endlink.

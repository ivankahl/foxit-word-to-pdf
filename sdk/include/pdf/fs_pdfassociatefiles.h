 * In PDF 2.0, a new concept named "Associated files" is defined. Associated files provide a means to

 * the content and the objects. Such associated files are designated using file specification
 * dictionaries (known as file specification). Associated files could be linked to the PDF document's catalog,

 * Specially, associated files with graphics objects means to be associated with the marked content item.<br>

 * count/get associate files in PDF dictionary or graphics object, to associate files (represented by @link FileSpec @endlink)
 * with catalog, PDF pages, graphics objects, form XObject objects, annotation objects and so on.<br>

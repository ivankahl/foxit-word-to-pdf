/**
 * In order to display page contents in a small screen device, Foxit PDF SDK introduces the concept of "reflow page".
 * In the reflow page, original PDF page contents will be laid out to fit the specified screen size.<br>
 * For a PDF page, user may wants to keep focusing on a location in the reflow page when user switches between
 * this PDF page and its related reflow page, or switch among these related reflow pages which are in different size.
 * In order to track the focus location, Foxit PDF SDK uses "focus data" to represent the focus location.
 * Focus data is similar to bookmark or destination in PDF, but it is simpler. User can store the focus data
 * (or save the data to file) so that user can retrieve the focus location again by the focus data later, even if
 * the size of reflow page is changed.<br>
 * A reflow page object should be constructed from a parsed PDF page. This class offers functions to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Start to parse a reflow page by functions @link ReflowPage::StartParse @endlink. Before parsing a reflow page,
 *     use should use function @link ReflowPage::SetScreenSize @endlink to specify the screen size for the reflow page.
 *     User can also use following functions to specify other factors which will affect on the parsing result
 *     for the reflow page: @link ReflowPage::SetZoom @endlink, @link ReflowPage::SetParseFlags @endlink,
 *     @link ReflowPage::SetLineSpace @endlink, @link ReflowPage::SetImageScale @endlink, @link ReflowPage::SetTopSpace @endlink. 
 *     If these function are not called before parsing a reflow page, default values will be used. Please refer to comment of these functions
 *     for more details. </li>
 * <li>Get the actual content size and matrix of a parsed reflow page, by functions
 *     @link ReflowPage::GetContentWidth @endlink, @link ReflowPage::GetContentHeight @endlink,@link ReflowPage::GetDisplayMatrix @endlink.
 * </li>
 * <li>Get the focus data for a specified position in reflow page, by function @link ReflowPage::GetFocusData @endlink,
 *     or retrieve the position by a focus data, by function @link ReflowPage::GetFocusPosition @endlink. </li>
 * </ul>
 * To render the reflow page, please use function @link common::Renderer::StartRenderReflowPage @endlink.
 *
 * @see @link PDFPage @endlink

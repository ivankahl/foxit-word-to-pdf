/**
 * Name tree is a kind of common data structure in PDF. Name tree serves a similar purpose to PDF dictionary
 * - associating keys and values - but by different means: in the name tree, a key name is treated as
 * an alias of its value object. That means, the value object can be referred to by the key name instead of
 * by reference object.<br>
 * Name tree has following characteristics:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>key names in a name tree are ordered and each key name in the same name tree is unique;</li>
 * <li>values associated with the key names may be objects of any type, depending on the purpose of the name tree;</li>
 * <li>name tree can represent an arbitrarily large collection of key-value pairs, which can be looked up efficiently
 *     without requiring the entire data structure to be read from the PDF file.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Class @link PDFNameTree @endlink is used to be associated with an existing name tree with specified type or create one.
 * It offers functions to get key-value pairs in the name tree, and set/add/remove any key-value pair.
 * Currently, class @link PDFNameTree @endlink can be associated with following name trees defined in PDF document:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Destinations name tree (with type @link PDFNameTree::e_Dests @endlink),
 *     which maps name strings to destinations. Values in this name tree should be a destination array
 *     (or a reference object to destination array).</li>
 * <li>JavaScript name tree (with type @link PDFNameTree::e_JavaScript @endlink),
 *     which maps name strings to document-level JavaScript actions. Values in this name tree should be
 *     a javaScript action dictionary (or a reference object to javaScript action dictionary).</li>
 * <li>EmbeddedFiles name tree, with type @link PDFNameTree::e_EmbeddedFiles @endlink, which maps name strings to
 *     file specifications for embedded file streams. Values in this name tree should be
 *     a file specification dictionary (or a reference object to file specification dictionary),
 *     which contains an embedded file stream.</li>
 * <li>Pages name tree, with type @link PDFNameTree::e_Pages @endlink, which maps name strings to
 *     pages. Values in this name tree should be a reference object to a page dictionary.</li>
 * <li>Templates name tree, with type @link PDFNameTree::e_Templates @endlink, which maps name strings to
 *     hidden pages. Values in this name tree should be a reference object to a hidden page dictionary. 
 *     Please use function @link pdf::PDFDoc::HidePageTemplate @endlink to hide pages.</li>
 * </ul>
 * For convenient use about embedded files (known as attachments as well) in a PDF document,
 * please refer to class @link pdf::Attachments @endlink.
 *
 * @see @link pdf::Attachments @endlink

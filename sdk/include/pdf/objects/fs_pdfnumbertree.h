/**
 * Number tree is a kind of common data structure in PDF. A number tree is similar to a number tree, except
 * that keys in a number tree are integers instead of strings and are sorted in ascending numerical order.
 * Number tree has following characteristics:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>key integers in a number tree are sorted in ascending numerical order and each key integer
 *     in the same number tree is unique;</li>
 * <li>values associated with the key integers may be objects of any type, depending on the purpose of the number tree;</li>
 * <li>number tree can represent an arbitrarily large collection of key-value pairs, which can be looked up
 *     efficiently without requiring the entire data structure to be read from the PDF file.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Class @link PDFNumberTree @endlink is used to be associated with an existing number tree with specified type or create one.
 * It offers functions to get key-value pairs in the number tree, and set/add/remove any key-value pair.
 * Currently, class @link PDFNumberTree @endlink can be associated with following number tree defined in PDF document:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Page labels number tree (with type @link PDFNumberTree::e_PageLabels @endlink),
 *     which defines the page labeling for the document. The keys in this tree are page indexes;
 *     the corresponding values are page label dictionaries (Please refer to <PDF Renferece 1.7> P594 Section 8.3.1,
 *     "Page Labels"). Each page index denotes the first page in a labeling range to which the specified
 *     page label dictionary applies. The tree must include a value for page index 0.</li>
 * </ul>
